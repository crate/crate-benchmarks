==================
CrateDB Benchmarks
==================

A collection of CrateDB_ benchmarks.

These benchmarks do not produce exact, reproducable results. Benchmark results
are mostly used to compare performance between two different CrateDB versions.

Current benchmarks:

- The py_ folder contains a set of ``spec`` and ``track`` files for use with
  cr8_.

- The api_ folder contains a Flask_ application that reads CrateDB benchmark
  results from Microsoft Azure.
